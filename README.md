# Library Management System
A junior‑level backend project built with Java and Spring Boot.

## Purpose
This project is part of my learning journey as I enter the software development field. Scrum principles will guide my agile development to show what I learned obtaining my recent Scrum PSM 1 Certificate (https://www.scrum.org/certificates/1247390.)   
It demonstrates my ability to design and implement a complete backend application following clean architecture principles, using Java, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL.

## Tech Stack
- Java 17  
- Spring Boot  
- PostgreSQL  
- Flyway  
- JUnit  

## Features (Sprint 1)
- Book entity  
- CRUD operations  
- REST API  
- Basic validation  
- Database migrations  

## Roadmap
- Sprint 1: Book management  
- Sprint 2: User management  
- Sprint 3: Borrowing and returning books  
- Sprint 4: Search and filtering  
- Sprint 5: Authentication and roles  
- Sprint 6: Dashboard and improvements  

## How to Run
1. Install Java 17 and Maven  
2. Configure PostgreSQL and update `application.properties`  
3. Run the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
